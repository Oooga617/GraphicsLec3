# making the repository:
# I was able to make both the unity project and repository under 5 minutes, which is good for mid-terms and exams.
# I think my time is still relatively the same as before, but I feel a bit more focused and anticipating on how long it will take for unity to create and load the Universial 3D project.
# So, I am a little nervous on something really bad happening coincendantlly on exam day or so, even if all I'm going to do was create the unity project first, then quickly boot up
# github desktop to make a new repository and link my unity project with it and then publish it publically while including in the ReadMe and gitignore the unity. 

# the inclass-activity:
# trying to do the code for the shader was difficult to say the least. It is mainly that to my frustration despite seemingly copying the code from the slides perfectly,
# there is an error that keeps popping up and Unity does not do a good job of telling me what is wrong. My issue is mainly from grammar mistakes, like a missing colon or typo
# that it very hard for me to spot. 
# with that said, the only thing that keeps me want to at least try is perseverence on my end, and after using Shader Graph in my last tutorial i am kind of excited to try and 
# successfully make more shaders that work in the future. I personally think I'm more comfortable with Shader Graph than Shader Lab honestly.
