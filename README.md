# I was able to make both the unity project and repository under 5 minutes, which is good for mid-terms and exams.
# I think my time is still relatively the same as before, but I feel a bit more focused and anticipating on how long it will take for unity to create and load the Universial 3D project.
# So, I am a little nervous on something really bad happening coincendantlly on exam day or so, even if all I'm going to do was create the unity project first, then quickly boot up
# github desktop to make a new repository and link my unity project with it and then publish it publically while including in the ReadMe and gitignore the unity.
